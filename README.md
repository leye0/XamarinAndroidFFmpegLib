Xamarin Android FFmpeg and libavcodec

This is a demo about how to use an ARMv7 compiled libavcodec dynamic library 
in a C# Xamarin Android application to process media files.

Interops have been created on the fly for the demo purpose, so the project is not directly usable outside of the demo context, 
but it should give an idea about how to access more advanced libavcodec functionalities.
